	<scores><![CDATA[<h2>Your Score</h2>
	
		<h3>15-24 points = Weak Link</h3>
		
		<p>You and your friend aren’t very close and probably don’t share your thoughts or feelings very often. This is probably not a friend you come to when you have a problem. Friends like these can go one of two ways. First, you might not be very happy and want more from the friendship. Or, you might be okay with where the friendship’s at and want to keep it that way, especially if you have other, closer friends.</p>
		
		<h3>25-34 points = Cautious Connection</h3>
		
		<p>You and your friend are somewhat close. You probably share some of your thoughts and feelings with each other, but there might be things that you are holding back. You might find that putting in more effort can bring the two of you closer.</p>
		
		<h3>35-45 points = Feel-good Friends</h3>
		
		<p>You and your friend are pretty close. You are loyal and more likely to share your thoughts and feelings with each other. Chances are that you are happy in this friendship.</p>
